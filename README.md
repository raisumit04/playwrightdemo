Perfect — here’s a version of the `README.md` tailored for **JavaScript** (Playwright with JS, not TypeScript).
It uses JavaScript file names and slightly simpler references.

# 📚 Project Name

## ⚠️ Note on Intentionally Failing Tests

> **Important:**
> Some test cases in this project are **intentionally designed to fail**.
> This is done to:
>
> * Demonstrate how Playwright reports failures.
> * Show screenshot & trace capturing in failure scenarios.
>


## 🛠 Configuration

Playwright is configured in:

```
playwright.config.js
```

Adjust browser settings, timeouts, retries, and more there.
